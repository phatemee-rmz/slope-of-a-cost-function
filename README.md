# Cost Function and Its Derivative

This repository contains a simple implementation of a cost function and its derivative using Python's `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries.

## Overview
The script visualizes:
- A quadratic cost function: $\( f(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \)$
- Its derivative: $\( f'(x) = 2x + 1 \)$

By plotting these functions side by side, we can observe how the slope of the cost function behaves at different values of \( x \).

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```python
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or a Python environment supporting inline plots:
```python
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Output
The script generates two plots:
1. The cost function plot
2. The slope (derivative) of the cost function

These simple visualizations help in understanding the concept of optimization.
